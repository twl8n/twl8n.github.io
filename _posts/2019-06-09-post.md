#### Some of the things we grow

We grow sweet cane sorghum. Here is a picture of me with some standing sorghum, and a load of cut cane on the tractor's forks.

Some harvest seasons we stack the cut cane on the back of the pickup.

We used to have the cane mill outside in the back yard. The red thing is the mill, powered by a home-made contraption.

Crushing the cane releases the juice. We filter that before boiling down into syrup.

We have a small wood fired evaporator pan.
