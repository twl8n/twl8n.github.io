#### Corn looks great

This Cherokee White corn looks great. Row cover after planting seems to have kept the turkeys and crows away. Last year they ate 95% of the new seedlings. This year all have survived (so far). The row cover was removed last week.

#### Muscadines are flowering

The muscadines (a native Southeastern grape) are doing great. The vines are loaded with flower clusters which have just started to open.

#### Black Twig apples

We have 6 Black Twig apple trees, and the four-year-old trees are fruiting! They are young trees, so I plucked most of the flowers, but I'm letting a few mature. The apples are so cute.

#### Chinkapins have little nuts

We have a couple dozen chinkapin bushes. These are a small native tree with nuts which are a bit like small chestnuts. Catkins have just opened on some bushes, and others already have small nuts forming.
