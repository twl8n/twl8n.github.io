#### Tiny flowers

Muscadine flowers are small, globular bunches. Bees and small bugs like them, so I guess the flowers have some nectar. This is the variety called Nobel, and the flowers open at different times.

#### Tiny fruit

The fruit grows quickly. Just a week or two later we can recognize small muscadines. When ripe, these will turn a deep, purple color. The bubunches are not as tight as wine grapes.
