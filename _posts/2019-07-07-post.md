#### The big storm

The afternoon of June 17, an intense storm blew through. The wind blasted in from the west. We were lucky to only have a few broken branches. Lots of people had full grown trees blown down. The power was out for 2 hours.

This was the view in our backyard:

A big branch blew out of the poplar into the front yard. After the storm, the back yard was a mess with branches from the sycamore and maple.

We rented a lift. Tom went up with a chainsaw to cut out the hanging branches. The lift is perfectly safe, but it bounces. And Tom isn't fond of heights. It worked out.

We hauled 4 loads of brush up to the brush pile. The tractor front end loader with pallet forks is very, very handy. Here is two of those loads:
