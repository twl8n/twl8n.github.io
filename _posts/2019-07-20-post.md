#### Wind storms not withstanding

We've had plenty of rain this year, and things are growing like crazy.

The Cherokee White field corn (great for corn meal) just got its first tassle:

The muscadines (variety "Nobel") are going great. It is a wonder how much pruning helps. And these vines are now 4 years old. They are covered in muscadines. A few weeks ago we only had flowers and a few tiny, primordial muscadines. Now they are looking like actual fruit.

Abby planted a pumpkin patch, and she's got one fair size pumpkin in there already.

The Black Twig apple trees are really too young for fruit, but I left one apple to mature, and it is doing well.
