#### Catching up

We've had a big Spring on the farm so far. It snowed on April 15, and we had a very late hard frost. Potatoes
were hit, along with trees (sycamore and oak), which I've never seen. Cherry trees were fine.

We've been doing a lot of maintenance. I pruned the hazelnuts, which made several huge piles of brush. I can
move a pickup-truck load of brush with the tractor. I swap the front end loader bucket for pallet forks.
