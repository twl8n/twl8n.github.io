#### About Celadon Acres Farm

We are Abby Rice and Tom Laudeman, studio potters and farmers. We grow Cherokee White and Bloody Butcher
varieties of corn for cornmeal, as well as muscadines (scuppernogs), hazelnuts, chinkapins, and a few
blueberries. Abby puts in a huge vegetable garden every year.
