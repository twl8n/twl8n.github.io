#### About Celadon Acres Farm

We are Abby Rice and Tom Laudeman, studio potters and farmers. We grow sweet sorghum which we make into
sorghum syrup (some old timers call it molasses). We also grow Cherokee White corn for cornmeal, as well as
muscadines, hazelnuts, chinkapins, and a few blueberries. Abby puts in a huge vegetable garden every year.
Some years we also grow Bloody Butcher corn for cornmeal.
