#### Cornmeal

Grown here on our farm spray free and sustainable. All our corn is open pollenated, heritage, non-GMO. Cherokee White has off-white kernels makes sweet, fluffy corn bread. Bloody Butcher has deep red kernels with a white interior. The corn meal has red flecks.

This is what the corn field looks like at the end of May.
