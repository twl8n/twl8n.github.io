#### Sorghum syrup and corn meal for sale

We sell sorghum syrup and corn meal at our farm. Both are grown here using sustainable practices, free from herbicides and pesticides. We currently have Cherokee White corn meal. Cherokee White is an open pollenated, heritage, dent corn that makes sweet, fluffy corn bread. We have also grown Bloody Butcher corn.

- Cherokee White corn meal, 1 pound $2.50

#### Corn planting

Corn is planted in the late spring, when the soil has warmed up. Tom has the planter ready to go in this photo.

#### Sorghum season at Celadon Acres Farm

#### Two rows cut down

In the middle of September we started cutting the sorghum, squeezing the cane, and making syrup. In this
picture, the first two rows have been cut and hauled out of the field.
