#### Cornmeal

Grown here on our farm using sustainable farming practices. Cherokee White is an open pollenated, heritage,
dent corn that makes sweet, fluffy corn bread. Bloody Butcher is a deep red hulls, with a white interior. The corn meal has red flecks.

This is what the corn looked like at the end of May.
