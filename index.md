#### Cornmeal

Grown here on our farm using sustainable farming practices. Cherokee White is an open pollenated, heritage,
dent corn that makes sweet, fluffy corn bread. 

#### Celadon Acres Pottery Studio and Gallery

We make fine ceramics and pottery in a small studio here at the farm. We have an outdoor display as part of our farm stand.
