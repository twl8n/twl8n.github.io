#### Sorghum syrup and cornmeal

Grown here on our farm using sustainable farming practices. Cherokee White is an open pollenated, heritage,
dent corn that makes sweet, fluffy corn bread. Sorghum syrup (some people call it sorghum molasses) is a
natural sweetener. Sorghum is a thick, rich syrup with a unique flavor reminiscent of caramel, vanilla and
dried fruit. It is fantastic as a topping on ice cream, oatmeal, pancakes, and as a sweetener in baked goods.

#### Celadon Acres Pottery Studio and Gallery

We make fine ceramics and pottery in a small studio here at the farm. We have an outdoor display as part of our farm stand.
