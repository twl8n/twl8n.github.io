#### Recipes

We use this cookbook all the time. We especially like the Spicy Sorghum-Glazed Pecans, and the Sorghum and Bourbon Pecan Pie recipes.

#### Caramel Corn 

- 4 qt. popped corn

- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract


Spray inside of a large, brown, paper grocery bag with Pam. Pour popped corn into bag. In a 1-quart, or larger, microwave bowl, combine brown sugar, margarine (butter), sorghum and salt. Microwave on HIGH for 3 minutes; stir. Microwave on HIGH another 3 minutes. Remove from overn and add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon soda; mix well. Pour mixture over the popcorn in the bag. Fold down top and shake bag. Microwave on HIGH for 1 minute. Remove bag and shake well. Do this 2 more times. (Total of three minutes.) Store in an airtight container. This is so quick and easy and keeps for several days. Recipe from "Sorghum Treasures: A Compliation of Recipes - Old and New"
